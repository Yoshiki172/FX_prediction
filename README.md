This program is a forex and stock price prediction program inspired by the paper "[Using Deep Learning Neural Networks and Candlestick Chart Representation to Predict the Stock Market](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12258.pdf)".

It is also a program that I created with the help of [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.12258.pdf](https://qiita.com/ryosao/items/32e30baa7374f78aeaf0)https://qiita.com/ryosao/items/32e30baa7374f78aeaf0) site.

This program is currently in the testing phase and may be modified in the future. It has also been confirmed to work with Google Colab.

First, download the training data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZTl-fzOiouXQde_TP2I2o-bj5nf31IEb/view?usp=drive_link) and store it in the 'base_model' directory. By executing the following code, you will be able to predict whether the EUR/JPY exchange rate will rise or fall the next day.

```
python prediction.py
